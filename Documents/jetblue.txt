Jet Blue will never leave me stranded again
My last two trips with Jet Blue have left me stranded. First a couple years ago in Puerto Rico and most recently in New York. We arrived in New York from Saint Lucia on a Sunday evening only to find our connection flight to Boston was cancelled according to them due to weather although other airlines were flying to Boston that night. There was no one to talk to and no information regarding another flight. We rented a car and drove home that night. On Monday afternoon they notified us that they could get us on a flight Tuesday evening, glad I didn't hang around and wait for them!! The final insult is they refunded the last leg of my flight, refunding to us $ 80 dollars of a thousand dollar flight. FWIW, they also ran out of food . Never again Jet Blue!!
JET BLUE VACATIONS THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!
I don't really write reviews but I'd thought I share my experience with JetBlue VACATIONS. The level of service I received was top notch. (UNHEARD of)
Our long waited, anticipated family vacation didn't look too optimistic due to the hurricane happening in FL. ( I usually book with Expedia but wanted to use the credit I had with Jet blue flights) A few days before our depart date, I contacted JetBlue Vacation, they kindly refunded my money in full including my travel credit although I had no travel insurance . The agent (McKenzi} was empathetic, attentive and MOST of all KIND.
I would definitely book with them again.
TERRIBLE, AVOID, NEGLECTFUL
TERRIBLE. AVOID traveling with JetBlue.
ANYONE WHO HAD A FLIGHT CANCELED ON SUNDAY AUGUST 4TH 2024? I'M ABOUT TO GET A LAWYER TO ENFORCE MY RIGHTS.
My flight has been canceled a few hours before departure. Jetblue didn't offer any alternative. They didn't try to find another flight, they didn't offer a compensation.. NOTHING.
They said the next flight is the next day (a monday) which means: I had to spend one more night in a hotel, get a taxi, get some food, AND BUY ANOTHER FLIGHT for the next day, AND I wasn't able to go to work of course..
They just didn't care if I wasn't able to go back home on time for work, they didn't care if I spent more than $400 to stay one more night and get another flight... THEY NEVER OFFERED A REFUND. THEY SAID THEY ARE NOT OBLIGED TO REIMBURSE THESE EXPENSES. THEY DON'T RESPECT THE RULES MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (which requires full refund of the flight + hotel + transportation + food).
THIS IS A TERRIBLE COMPANY. AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE: MARIA WHO I CHATTED WITH, CLOSED THE CHAT WITHOUT MY CONSENT, JUST BECAUSE I WAS INSISTING FOR A REFUND AND SHOWING HER THE RULES MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.
JETBLUE DOESN'T RESPECT THE REGULATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. THEY MAKE THEIR OWN RULES. THEY DISREGARD THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. THEY ARE NOT LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS BUT THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO AVOID BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE.
AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I DID TRAVEL A LOT WITH THEM. FLIGHTS ARE EITHER DELAYED OR CANCELED. CHOOSE A SERIOUS COMPANY WHO CARES FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS.
bad experience with JetBlue
I am completely disappointed with this company, get out of them, everything happened to go and come back, total lack of respect for customers, I bought my flight precisely for the arrival time at my destination in Punta Cana which would be 10:30 am, this way I could make betterâ€¦
great airlines
jetblue did really an amazing job finding my luggage ,agent Tricci from MCO airport was super helpful.thank you again for delivering it to my house.
First time on jetBlue Airways. Very impressed indeed, especially with free WI-Fi. Highly recommended.
First time on jetBlue. As a non-legacy carrier I expected this to be cramped and very basic indeed. How wrong I was! Seats were comfortable with generous legroom. Aircraft interior looked new although the aircraft was an older A.320. Cabin service with free nibbles and soft drinks handed out by excellent, helpful znd gfriendly cabil crew. The high spot thpough was the end to end FREE Wi-Fi throughout the flight. Never had this in Economy on any other airline. Well done jetlue for leading the way with what, in this day and age, should be a standard offering. I cannot recommend more high;ly.
